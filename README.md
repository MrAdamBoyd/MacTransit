#Muni Menu Bar
This is the repository for my small tool that I use every day, Muni Menu Bar. It just lives in the menu bar of your computer and tells you when the next bus or train is coming. You can even have it display a different line for a different part of the day. So you can see the inbound trains in the morning and the outbound ones in the evening. You can even display entirely new lines.

You can view the website and download the app [here](http://mradamboyd.github.io/MuniMenuBar/).

### MacTransit
