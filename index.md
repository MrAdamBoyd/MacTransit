# TransitBar
This is the repository for my small tool that I use every day, TransitBar. It just lives in the menu bar of your computer and tells you when the next bus or train is coming.

You can download TransitBar from [GitHub](http://adamjboyd.com/TransitBar.zip) or the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transitbar-transit-times-in/id1185244899).
